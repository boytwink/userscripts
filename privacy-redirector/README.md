## ❓ FAQ

**How can I disable some redirections?**

> You have to edit the values of the userscript. Change the `REDIRECTION` value to
> `false` for the redirections you want. You can also disable [farside.link](https://github.com/benbusby/farside)
> and add your custom instances. A little familiarity with JavaScript syntax should
> be enough.

**Why scribe.rip doesn't redirect to user pages?**

> "It's intentional that there is no way to browse content from a user, see popular
> posts, consume via an RSS feed, or further engage with an article via comments or
> "claps".I want to spend my time encouraging writers to move to worthy platforms,
> not making a bad platform worthy."
